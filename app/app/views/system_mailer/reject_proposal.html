<h1>Dear <%= @project_proposal.name %></h1>,
<p>
    Thank you for your project submission. <br/>
    We have received many interesting and creative projects recently and due to the competitiveness from other projects, <br/>
    we regret to inform you that your project called <%= @project_proposal.title %> did not make the cut. <br/>
    However, we do hope that you will try to refine your idea and submit another proposal soon. <br/>
    We look forward in receiving your amended project proposal soon.<br/>
    The harder the struggle, the more glorious the triumph.
</p>
